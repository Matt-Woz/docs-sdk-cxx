The Couchbase {cpp} SDK allows logging to be configured programmatically. Internally, the SDK uses the
https://github.com/gabime/spdlog[spdlog] logging library.

Once the logger has been initialized, The default log level is `info`.

The following log levels are supported (in order of increasing amount of information logged):

. off
. critical
. error
. warning
. info
. debug
. trace

The {cpp} SDK can be configured to send logs to standard output, or to a file.
The logger can be initialized and logging level changed like so:
